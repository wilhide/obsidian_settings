# 🧠 Idea
> [!tip]
> Capture the **spark** — what inspired this project, why it matters, and what problem it solves.  
> Don’t overthink it; this is where raw ideas live before refinement.


---

# 🪜 Plan / Milestones
> [!tip]
> Outline the high-level steps or major checkpoints that will lead to completion.  
> These can be Tasks plugin checkboxes or general milestones.  
> Keep it flexible — this is your roadmap, not a contract.

# ⚙️ Work Log
> [!tip]
> Use this space as a **running journal of progress**.  
> Add short dated notes as you work — discoveries, issues, or decisions.  
> Each entry can link out to Research or How-to notes created during this project.

# 🪞 Reflection
> [!tip]
> When you reach a natural stopping point or project completion, summarize what you learned.  
> Ask yourself:  
> • What worked well?  
> • What didn’t?  
> • What would I do differently next time?  
> Capture insights worth turning into KB notes (Concepts, How-tos, Patterns, Research).
