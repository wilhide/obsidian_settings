> [!check] **Pattern or something else?**
> Use this note for **reusable design or solution frameworks** that can be adapted to many contexts.  
> It explains *how to think about solving a problem*, not just how to execute a procedure.  
> If this describes **a process for a single situation**, use a 🎛️ *Playbook*.  
> If it’s **a linear task**, use a 🛠️ *How-to*.  
> If it explains **the theory behind an idea**, use a 🧩 *Concept*.  
> If you’re compiling **findings or evidence**, use a 🔬 *Research* note.
